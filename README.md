Staff Software Eng - Test & Performance for Search & Personalization
====================


We anticipate that this problem will take you about 1 hour. We know that this is a significant time committment before a technical phone screen, but we want to ensure that we hire only exceptionally good test engineers and this helps us find them.

__Goal__: Prove yourself by fixing the provided average line length program (avgll)

__Usage__: 

To invoke the program on a file, use the -f option followed by a filename.

    $ avgll -f <filename>
    50.0

The output is a decimal number that represents the average line length of the file, which means the number of unicode characters on all the lines divided by the total number of lines.

__Code available here__: 
    
git clone from

    https://github.com/CheggEng/avg-line-length-java

__Step 1__:

You will notice upon running the program for the first time that it doesn't work at all. :(

Get it running and fix the obvious mistakes. 

After this step, save your solution as Step1.java

__Step 2__:

There are actually a lot of different things that you need to test to get the actual calculation right. We want to see how you think about figuring out all the cases. 

Put all your test data in a folder called data. We've provided a few things to try.

As you find test inputs that fail, fix the code to handle them.

When you're done, save your solution as Step2.java

__Step 3__:

Your code probably now works, but it's a mess. Oh wait, it was already a mess before you started :P

Refactor the code
